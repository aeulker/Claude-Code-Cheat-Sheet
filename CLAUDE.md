# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a documentation repository containing comprehensive reference materials for Claude Code and SuperClaude framework tools. The repository serves as a cheat sheet and quick reference guide for AI-powered development workflows.

## Key Files

- `claude-superclaude-cheatsheet.html`: Complete HTML reference guide covering:
  - Claude Code CLI commands and flags
  - SuperClaude framework slash commands (/sc:* commands)
  - Cognitive personas and workflow examples
  - Configuration templates and best practices
- `Claude Code Cheat Sheet.xlsx`: Excel version of the reference materials

## Content Structure

The HTML cheat sheet is organized into these main sections:

1. **Claude Code Tool Commands**: Core CLI commands, flags, and built-in slash commands
2. **SuperClaude Framework Commands**: All 16 slash commands (/sc:implement, /sc:analyze, etc.)
3. **Cognitive Personas**: 9 specialized personas (architect, frontend, backend, security, etc.)
4. **SuperClaude CLI**: GitHub workflow automation tools
5. **Common Workflows**: Step-by-step examples for development, debugging, and review
6. **Configuration**: Settings templates and MCP server configuration
7. **Best Practices**: Performance, security, and collaboration guidelines

## Working with This Repository

When modifying the documentation:

- The HTML file contains comprehensive styling and is self-contained
- Updates should maintain the structured table format for command references
- Code examples use syntax highlighting with specific CSS classes
- The navigation menu should be updated if new major sections are added
- All commands and examples should be tested and verified for accuracy

## Content Guidelines

- Commands are organized by tool type (Claude Code vs SuperClaude Framework vs SuperClaude CLI)
- Usage examples include both basic and advanced scenarios
- Workflow examples show realistic development scenarios
- Configuration examples use proper JSON formatting
- All technical content should reflect current tool capabilities

## Repository Status

This is a documentation-only repository with no build processes, tests, or deployment pipelines needed. Changes are primarily content updates to keep the reference materials current with tool evolution.
